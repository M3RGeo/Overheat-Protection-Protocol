# My Aim/Insperation for creating this - Also Regarding Support
I like the Core temp program a lot, i use it regalurly and the basic script that is the Alpha 1 version was created for use alongside Core Temp to shut down and protect my computer from Overheating.

But while i was working on a more advanced version of it that would have become Alpha 2 i realised that the GPU temprature isn't being monitored and while that won't seem significant to some, it is for me as i have had my GPU overheat in the past and it's almost just as bad as when it happens to the CPU.

Thus this newer version I'm working on isn't just a simple shut down script anymore but rather a full blown program that does all the monitoring itself. I aim to make it as good as Core Temp is but please understand this is just a side hobby for me and i only own a windows computer with an intel cpu and Nvidia GPU, i can't test other platforms and other Hardware properly due to this.

I might be able to test linux in a virtual machine but that's the furtest i can promise support.

# More Support & Info
As stated above i can only test on so many platforms and hardware as i own, if any of you are willing to help to test the hardware and platforms and then let me know on what it works without issue let me know. just create a issue on the Github, regarding languages, i'm not a translator so any help there would be welcome.

if you want to contribute to the project you are more than welcome to create a pull request.
